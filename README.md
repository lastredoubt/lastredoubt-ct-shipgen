# ct-shipgen

This set of vue scripts is designed to allow creating a Classic Traveller starship from the Traveller Book rules. 

The core is built in Vue

The dist folder has the built scripts that can be incorporated

The pluginprep folder has the wordpress plugin created that I've used on my own site: https://travellertools.thelastredoubt.com/

the zipped up wordpress plugin under pluginprep uses [ltctshipbuild] as the shortcode


Thanks,
